# NMFS_MOCHA MATLAB
All the code needed to read in NMFS and MOCHA data and compare the two annually. 
This repository includes all data and almost all the functions necessary to run the NMFS_MOCHA_Annual_Plots code. 
You may need Slocum Power Tools but that can be found with a google. 
I wrote this as part of my research at Rutger University in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences. 
NMFS is the National Marine Fisheries Service and the data is open to the public.
MOCHA is a climatological model written by a grad student at RU.
Any suggestions are welcome.
